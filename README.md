# React TypeScript Redux Docker Boilerplate

React TypeScript Docker Boilerplate is a starter project for building scalable and maintainable web applications with React 18, TypeScript, Redux and Docker. This boilerplate provides a robust and configurable development environment that supports hot-reloading, testing, linting, and building of React applications in a containerized environment. With TypeScript, developers can benefit from a statically-typed language that provides better type-checking and IDE support, resulting in fewer runtime errors and faster development cycles. Use this boilerplate to jumpstart your React projects and streamline your development workflow.
